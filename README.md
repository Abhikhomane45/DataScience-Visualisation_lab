# Data Science & Visualization
Practicals —  README

This document contains a brief overview of the nine practical experiments performed in Data Science using Python.

---

### **1. Correlation and Covariance**

**Aim:** To calculate correlation and covariance between different variables in a dataset and understand their relationship.
**Description:** The experiment involves using statistical formulas or Python functions to compute correlation and covariance. It helps identify how two variables are related — whether they move together positively, negatively, or not at all.

---

### **2. Mean, Median, Variance, Correlation, and Normal Distribution**

**Aim:** To calculate mean, median, and variance of a dataset and plot correlation and normal distribution graphs.
**Description:** The experiment includes finding measures of central tendency and spread, and visualizing data distribution. It helps understand the average behavior and variation in data.

### **3. Importing and Exporting CSV Files with Pandas**

**Aim:** To import and export CSV files using Pandas and analyze the data.
**Dataset:** employees.csv
**Description:** The experiment demonstrates reading a CSV file, viewing its shape and summary, checking for missing values, and calculating correlation between columns. It also involves exporting cleaned data back into a new CSV file.

### **4. Data Visualization Using Matplotlib (Iris Dataset)**

**Aim:** To demonstrate different plots using Matplotlib on the Iris dataset.
**Dataset:** Iris dataset
**Description:** The experiment involves creating visual representations of data such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and pair plots to understand relationships between different flower features.

---

### **5. Simple Linear Regression**

**Aim:** To implement simple linear regression using scikit-learn.
**Dataset:** newspaperData.csv
**Description:** The experiment demonstrates how one independent variable can be used to predict a dependent variable. It shows how to fit a line to data points and evaluate the model’s accuracy using R².

---

### **6. Multiple Linear Regression**

**Aim:** To implement multiple linear regression using scikit-learn.
**Dataset:** newspaperData.csv
**Description:** This experiment extends linear regression to include multiple independent variables. It helps analyze how several factors together influence the target variable, with evaluation metrics such as R² and adjusted R².

---

### **7. KMeans Clustering**

**Aim:** To implement KMeans clustering and divide data into groups.
**Dataset:** Customer dataset
**Description:** KMeans clustering groups similar data points together based on their features. The experiment also uses the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

---

### **8. DBSCAN Clustering and Comparison with KMeans**

**Aim:** To implement DBSCAN clustering and compare it with KMeans.
**Dataset:** Customer dataset
**Description:** DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can detect noise and irregular shapes of clusters. The experiment compares how DBSCAN and KMeans handle different data distributions.

---

### **9. Decision Tree Classifier (Iris Dataset)**

**Aim:** To implement a decision tree classifier to classify Iris flower species.
**Dataset:** Iris dataset
**Description:** A decision tree is built to predict the species of a flower based on its features. The experiment includes splitting data, training a model, testing accuracy, and visualizing the decision tree structure.

### **Conclusion**

These practicals cover the core aspects of data science — from basic data analysis, visualization, and regression, to clustering and classification. They help develop skills in exploring, modeling, and interpreting data effectively using Python.
